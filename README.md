## Adidas Performance Dashboard
## üìå Project Overview

    This project focuses on analyzing Adidas U.S. sales data to generate actionable business insights. Using only Microsoft Excel, I transformed raw sales data into a professional and interactive dashboard that highlights performance trends, profitability, and regional contributions.
    
    The primary aim was to simulate a real-world business analytics project where stakeholders can monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and make data-driven decisions.

## üéØ Business Questions Addressed

    Throughout the analysis, I sought to answer the following key questions:
    
    How much revenue did Adidas generate, and how profitable was it?
    
    Which products, regions, and retailers contributed the most to sales and profit?
    
    How evenly are sales distributed across the U.S., and where are the growth hotspots?
    
    What percentage contribution does each category, region, and retailer make to Adidas‚Äôs overall performance?

## üõ† Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

    Checked dataset for duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.
    
    Converted raw dataset into an Excel Table (Ctrl + T) to enable structured referencing.
    
    Created helper columns to support advanced calculations:
    
    Profit = Total Sales - Operating Cost
    
    Profit Margin (%) = Profit / Total Sales
    
    % Contribution to Sales = Total Sales / SUM(Total Sales)

2. Exploratory Analysis

    Applied PivotTables to explore sales trends by:
    
    Region
    
    Retailer
    
    Product Category
    
    State
    
    Used Conditional Formatting (Color Scales) to quickly identify high vs. low performers.

## 3. Dashboard Development

    Designed a single-page interactive dashboard with:
    
    KPI Cards ‚Üí showing Total Sales, Units Sold, and Profit Margin.
    
    Map Visualisation ‚Üí sales contribution by state.
    
    Bar & Column Charts ‚Üí revenue and profitability breakdown by product and retailer.
    
    Slicers ‚Üí filters for Year, Region, and Retailer to allow dynamic exploration.
    
    Added iconography (small icons above KPIs) for a professional, modern design.

## üìä Key Insights

    Total Sales & Units: Adidas achieved strong revenue across the U.S., with the West region contributing the largest share.
    
    Profitability: Certain retailers and regions delivered above-average profit margins, highlighting opportunities for strategic expansion.
    
    Category Performance: Footwear dominated sales, but Apparel provided higher relative margins.
    
    Contribution Analysis: Internal ‚Äúmarket share‚Äù breakdown showed that a few top retailers accounted for over half of total sales.
