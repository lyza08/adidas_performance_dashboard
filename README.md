## Adidas Performance Dashboard (2020‚Äì2021)
   ## Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing Adidas U.S. sales data to generate actionable business insights. Using only Microsoft Excel, I transformed raw sales data into a professional and interactive dashboard that highlights performance trends, profitability, and regional contributions.

The primary aim was to simulate a real-world business analytics project that allows stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and make data-driven decisions.

## Business Questions Addressed

Throughout the analysis, I sought to answer the following key questions:

How much revenue did Adidas generate, and how profitable was it?

Which products, regions, and retailers contributed the most to sales and profit?

How evenly are sales distributed across the U.S., and where are the growth hotspots?

What percentage contribution does each category, region, and retailer make to Adidas‚Äôs overall performance?

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked the dataset for duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.

Converted raw dataset into an Excel Table (Ctrl + T) to enable structured referencing.

Created helper columns to support advanced calculations:

Profit = Total Sales ‚Äì Operating Cost

Profit Margin (%) = Profit √∑ Total Sales

% Contribution to Sales = Total Sales √∑ SUM(Total Sales)

2. Exploratory Analysis

Applied PivotTables to explore sales trends by:

Region

Retailer

Product Category

State

Used Conditional Formatting (Colour Scales) to quickly identify high vs. low performers.

3. Dashboard Development

Designed a single-page interactive dashboard with:

KPI Cards ‚Üí showing Total Sales, Units Sold, and Profit Margin.

Bar & Column Charts ‚Üí revenue and profitability breakdown by product and retailer.

Map Visualisation ‚Üí sales contribution by state.

Slicers ‚Üí filters for Year, Region, and Retailer to allow dynamic exploration.

Iconography (small icons above KPIs) for a professional, modern design.

## Key Insights

Total Sales & Units: Adidas achieved strong revenue across the U.S., with the West region contributing the largest share.

Profitability: Certain retailers and regions delivered above-average profit margins, highlighting opportunities for strategic expansion.

Category Performance: Footwear dominated sales, but Apparel provided higher relative margins.

Contribution Analysis: Internal ‚Äúmarket share‚Äù breakdown showed that a few top retailers accounted for over half of total sales.

## Recommendations for Stakeholders

Based on the analysis of Adidas U.S. sales data, the following strategic recommendations are advised:

Focus on High-Performing Regions

The West region emerged as the strongest contributor to sales and profitability. Adidas should strengthen its presence here through expanded retail partnerships and increased marketing spend.

The South and Southeast regions, which show moderate contributions, could benefit from targeted promotions or localised product offerings.

Strengthen Retailer Partnerships

A small number of top retailers (e.g., Amazon, Foot Locker, and Walmart) account for a significant share of sales. Adidas should pursue exclusive product launches, loyalty programs, and marketing collaborations with these partners.

At the same time, expanding partnerships with mid-tier retailers such as Kohl‚Äôs and Sports Direct will help diversify sales channels and reduce reliance on a few major players.

Category-Level Strategy

Men‚Äôs Street Footwear is the best-performing product category. Expanding this line with seasonal collections and limited editions can further boost growth.

Women‚Äôs categories underperform relative to Men‚Äôs. Adidas should explore targeted campaigns, influencer collaborations, and community engagement to capture more market share.

## Optimise Sales Channels

With in-store sales being the largest contributor, Adidas should maintain flagship stores as a strong brand touchpoint.

At the same time, online sales present major growth opportunities. Investment in digital marketing, personalized shopping experiences, and e-commerce partnerships should be prioritized.

## Profitability Focus

Some regions and retailers delivered above-average profit margins, while others underperformed. Adidas should review cost structures and promotional spending in lower-margin areas and redirect resources to stronger markets.

## Data-Driven Growth Planning

A continuous dashboard monitoring system is recommended. This will allow Adidas management to track KPIs in real time and quickly respond to shifts in regional demand, retailer performance, or product trends.
